# Welkinsage Networks Firewall

Welkinsage Networks is proud to present our new open source firewall solution! This state-of-the-art software has been designed from the ground up to provide superior protection for your network, while also being incredibly easy to use.

Here are just a few of the ways in which our firewall beats the competition:

- **Intrusion detection and prevention**: Our firewall uses a powerful intrusion detection system to identify and block potential threats before they can do any damage.

- **Security policies**: You can easily configure security policies that determine which types of traffic are allowed or blocked. This makes it easy to tailor the firewall to your specific needs.

- **Web filtering**: The built-in web filter allows you to block access to dangerous or unwanted websites, as well as Limit bandwidth usage for different users or groups.

- **Open source**: Our firewall is open source, which means that it is constantly being improved by a community of passionate security experts.

# How to install?

## Requirements

To install and use Welkinsage Networks Firewall, you will need:

- 4 GB of RAM
- 2 GHz processor or faster
- 10 GB of free hard disk space

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/Welkinsage/Firewall`

2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   `cd Firewall`

3. Install the dependencies:
   `npm install`

4. Start the firewall:

## Usage

Once the firewall is up and running, all you need to do is point your devices to use the firewall as their gateway. By default, the firewall will allow all traffic. To change this, simply create a security policy that blocks the traffic you want to prevent.
